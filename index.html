The biggest wireless carrier in United States, Verizon Wireless operates a robust and far-reaching 4G LTE network and a strong lineup of smartphones, feature phones, and basic handsets. A joint venture between Verizon Communications and Vodafone, Verizon Wireless was formed in 2000 through a merger between GTE Wireless and Bell Atlantic. Things you should know about Verizon Wireless: Verizon has a "Share Everything" plan that includes unlimited and text and voice calls for multiple devices plus a monthly allotment of data use (single lines plans are available, as well).

As a CDMA carrier, Verizon's international coverage is limited to a handful of countries, but it offers dual-mode CDMA/GSM handsets. Verizon offers prepaid plans. Verizon announced Edge, its early upgrade program.
